## Implementation

### SC System Design
#### State Variables
* `contributionsMap` of type `mapping` has:
    - key: `address`
    - value: array of `FundData` where,
        + `FundData` is a struct of attributes:
            - `tokenAmt` of type: `uint256`
            - `stableCoinAmt` of type: `uint256`
* `totalPTAmt` of type `uint256`
* `totalStableCoinAmt` of type `uint256`
* `totalCirculatingStableCoinAmt` of type `uint256`
* `projectFeeAmt` of type `uint256`
* `protocolFeeAmt` of type `uint256`
* `projectToken` of type `address`
* `coinAddress` of type `address`
* `allocatedPCAmt` of type `address`
* `projectOwnerAddr` of type `address`
* `treasuryAddress` of type `address`
* `minFundingThreshold` of type `uint256`
* `startTimestamp` of type `uint256`
* `endTimestamp` of type `uint256`
* `stableCoinAddress` of type `address`
* `projectOwnerFeePt` of type `uint16`

#### Upgradeable Initializer 
* Set the project coin address `coinAddress`.
* Set the stable coin address `stableCoinAddress`.
* Set the project fee as percent (10000 > fee >= 0) `projectOwnerFeePt`.
* Deploy the mintable project token with name "T******"(Protocal Symbol "T" + Project name`s first 6 letters uppercase)
* Set treasury address as default: `0xaFA6058126D8f48d49A9A4b127ef7e27C5e1DC43`
* Initialize with Ownable in order to set the deployer as admin, which can be viewed using `owner()` function (inherited from `OwnableUpgradeable`).
* Initialize with Pausable (inherited from `PausableUpgradeable`) 
* Initialize with ReentrancyGuard for contract security (inherited from `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`).
